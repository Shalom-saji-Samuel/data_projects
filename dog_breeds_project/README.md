# Project Title - Dog_breeds_project

## Description
Through this project I have tried to show which dog breeds are more popular , their life span etc.


## Tools Used
- Excel (to clean and view the data)
- power bi (to visualize my findings)

## Dataset Source
- Kaggle.

## Process
1. I viewed the data in excel. 
2. Then rearranged the rows and handled some missing values.
3. In the end I used power bi to build a dashboard .  

## Key Insights
- One interesting finding was in most cases if the dog breed has more energy level it has less life span and if the dog had less energy level it had more life expectancy 
- Another finding was people liked dogs which had medium energy levels.
