# Organizational Hierarchy SQL Project

This project explores hierarchical relationships using **Recursive CTEs in SQL**.

It simulates a companyâ€™s structure with two main tables:
- `departments`: representing department hierarchy
- `employees`: representing employee-manager relationships

## Topics Covered
- Recursive CTEs
- Finding department depth and structure
- Building manager chains
- Counting indirect reports
- SQL concepts like `JOIN`, `UNION`, `GROUP_CONCAT`, `MAX`, etc.

## How to Run
1. Open the file in any SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench)
2. Run the full script to:
   - Create tables
   - Insert sample data
   - See recursive CTE queries in action

## Example Tasks
- Find all departments under 'Corporate' with their levels
- Display a manager chain from any employee (e.g., Hannah or Alice)
- Count how many people report (indirectly) to a manager
